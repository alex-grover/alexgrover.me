My personal website. Design taken from the fantastic [Nim](https://github.com/ibelick/nim) template and rewritten in plain HTML, CSS, and (optional) JS as an exercise in minimalism. Each page is a single file, with no build step - the exact code that was written gets shipped directly to the browser.

The only JavaScript used is 1. progressive enhancement of the theme selector, to save the user's preference after page loads and sync across tabs, and 2. the Vercel Analytics snippet.
